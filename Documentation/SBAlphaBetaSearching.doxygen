/** @protocol SBAlphaBetaSearching

States @em must implement this protocol to be used with SBAlphaBeta.

In addition to the methods in this protocol it is advised that you
override -description to return something sensible. This can make
debugging easier if you make a false step and feed SBAlphaBeta
unexpected data. (Because the exceptions thrown will make more sense.)
