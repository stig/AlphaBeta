/** @page xcode Xcode Integrated documentation

Statistics' documentation can be integrated into Xcode 3. To do this,
open Terminal.app and cd into the Documentation directory in the
Statistics___VERSION__ bundle. You can then simply type "make install"
to install the docset into
~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets so that Xcode will
find it at startup.

The integrated documentation can be removed by running "make
uninstall" from the same directory.
