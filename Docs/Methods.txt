+ (id)newWithState:(id)this

    This method is a shortcut for calling alloc & initWithState:.

- (id)init

- (id)initWithState:(id)this

    Initialise an SBAlphaBeta object with a starting state.
    
- (id)moveFromSearchWithDepth:(unsigned)ply

    Performs a fixed-depth search to the given @p ply. Returns the
    best move found.

- (id)performMoveFromSearchWithDepth:(unsigned)ply

    Performs a fixed-depth search to the given @p ply and applies the
    best move found.

- (id)moveFromSearchWithInterval:(NSTimeInterval)interval

    Performs an iterative search for up to @p interval seconds. Return
    the best move found.

    Fractional seconds are supported, so an interval of 0.3 makes for
    a search that lasts up to 300 milliseconds.

- (id)performMoveFromSearchWithInterval:(NSTimeInterval)interval

    Performs an iterative search for up to @p interval seconds and
    applies the best move found.

    Fractional seconds are supported, so an interval of 0.3 makes for
    a search that lasts up to 300 milliseconds.

- (id)performMove:(id)m

    Apply the given move to the current state. Returns the new current
    state.

- (id)undoLastMove

    Undo one position from the given state. Returns the new current
    state.

- (id)currentState

    Returns the current state.

- (id)lastMove

    Returns the last move that was applied.

- (unsigned)countPerformedMoves

    Returns a count of the number of moves since the initial state.

- (unsigned)currentPlayer

    Returns 1 or 2, depending on whose turn it is to move. Player "1"
    is arbitrarily defined to be the player whose turn it is to play
    at the start of the game, which is not necessarily the same as the
    state itself thinks of as player 1 (if it thinks of the players in
    those terms; it may use @"a" or @"b" instead).

- (unsigned)winner

    Returns 1 or 2 for the winning player, or 0 if the game ended in a
    draw.

- (BOOL)isGameOver

    Returns true if the game is finished, false otherwise.

- (unsigned)depthForSearch

    Return the depth reached by the last iterative search. The
    returned value is undefined if no iterative search has been
    executed yet.

- (unsigned)stateCountForSearch

    Return the number of states visited by the last search.

    If the last search was an iterative one, the number of visited
    states is accumulated across all the *completed* iterations.

- (BOOL)isForcedPass

    Returns true if the current player is forced to pass. (I.e., her
    only legal move is a pass move.)

- (double)currentFitness

    Returns currentFitness from the current state.

- (NSArray *)currentLegalMoves

    Returns available moves from the current state.
