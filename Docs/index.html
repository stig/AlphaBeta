<p><em>AlphaBeta</em> is a Cocoa Objective-C framework encapsulating
the Alpha-Beta game-tree search algorithm. It can be used to create
computer players for a whole range of games including Chess, Checkers,
Go, Reversi/Othello, Connect-4 and Tic-Tac-Toe to mention but a
few.</p>

<p>More specifically, Alpha-Beta search can be used in all two-player
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum">zero sum</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information">perfect
information</a> games. The term <em>two-player</em> just means that
there must be two opposing sides. (Football is considered two-player,
for example.) A <em>zero sum</em> game is one where an advantage for
one player is an equally large disadvantage for the other. <em>Perfect
information</em> basically rules out any game that has an element of
chance. This last rule disqualifies Yatzee, Poker and&mdash;most
definitely&mdash;Jenga.</p>

<p>The framework aims to be easy to use: there's no need for prior
experience with AI (Artificial Intelligence). You don't actually have
to learn anything about game-tree search in order to use this
framework. Should you desire to, the <a
href="#resources">resources</a> section has links to more information
about game-tree search and relevant algorithms.</p>


<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>To use AlphaBeta you need to initialise an instance of SBAlphaBeta
with an instance of your game state class. This instance will be used
as the initial state of the game. A state is a discrete game
state&mdash;a point in time between moves. A move contains the
information required for transforming a state into its successor.</p>

<p>AlphaBeta does not care what types your states are. Only that they
implement the <a href="#alphabetasearching">SBAlphaBetaSearching</a>
protocol. If you wish you could implement this protocol as a category
on an existing class. Neither does AlphaBeta care about the type of
your moves. (With an exception for <em>pass moves</em>. These must be
represented by an NSNull instance.) They must implement a simple
informal protocol. </p>

<p>Though not required it is advised that you override -description to
return something sensible for both states and moves. This can make
debugging easier if you make a false step and feed SBAlphaBeta
unexpected data, as the exceptions thrown will make more sense.</p>

<h2 id="protocols">Protocols</h2>

<p>The protocols listed below are defined in the
<code>SBAlphaBeta.h</code> header file. Don't include this directly
though. Include the <code>AlphaBeta/AlphaBeta.h</code> header
instead.</p>


<h3>SBAlphaBetaSearching [required]</h3>

<p>Your state class <em>must</em> implement all the methods specified
by this protocol. In addition to the NSCoding protocol, its methods
and their responsebilities are:</p>

<dl>

<dt><pre>- (double)fitness;</pre></dt>
<dd><p>This method should return the _fitness_ of the state. The
fitness is a number indicating how fortuitous the state is for the
current player. (I.e. the probability of winning after reaching this
state.)</p>
        
<p>Use a large positive number to indicate that a state is very good,
or a large negative number for very bad.</p> </dd>

<dt><pre>- (NSArray *)legalMoves;</pre></dt>

<dd><p>This method must be implemented to return an array of all the
legal moves available to the current player.</p>
        
<p>Return an empty array to signify that there are no moves possible
and that this is an end state. (A.k.a. "leaf state".)</p>
        
<p>Return an array containing a single NSNull instance to signify that
the current player is forced to pass. (If your game supports this.) If
passing is always an option, this method must always return a pass
move.</p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (void)applyMove:(id)m;</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Must transform a state into its successor given a valid move.
Must be implemented to handle pass moves, if your game supports these.
Given a pass move, this method must at the very least update the
receiver's idea of which player's turn it is.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Informal protocol for moves [required]</h3>

<p>Moves <em>must</em> implement the following informal protocol.
NSArray, NSDictionary, NSString and NSNumber already implement it so
if you define your moves in terms of these you get this protocol for
free.</p>

<pre>
-(BOOL)isEqual:(id)object;
-(unsigned)hash;
</pre>


<h3>SBAlphaBetaStatus [optional]</h3>

<p>Implement this <em>optional</em> protocol if you want AlphaBeta to
be able to tell you which player won at the end of the game. It adds
the following methods:</p>

<dl>

<dt><pre>- (BOOL)isDraw;</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Must be implemented to return <code>YES</code> if this state
is a draw, i.e. none of the players won. This method is <em>only</em>
called by AlphaBeta at the end of a game.</p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (BOOL)isWin;</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Must be implemented to return <code>YES</code> if this state is
a win <em>from the perspective of the current player</em>. This method
is <em>only</em> called by AlphaBeta at the end of a game.</p></dd>


</dl>


<h3>SBUndoableAlphaBetaSearch [optional]</h3>

<p>AlphaBeta normally calls -copy on your states a lot during search.
If calling -copy is particularly expensive your states may
<em>optionally</em> implement this protocol. It contains only one
method:</p>

<dl>
<dt><pre>- (void)undoMove:(id)m;</pre></dt>

<dd><p>This is the opposite of -applyMove:. The move passed to it will
always be the <em>last</em> move that was applied to the receiver with
-applyMove:. The effect of this method should be to produce the
previous state.</p>

<p>This means that each move returned by -legalMoves must contain
enough information to revert the move. For Reversi, for example, each
move could be an array of co-ordinates: the first is the slot to put
the current piece, the remaining are for pieces to flip.</p>

</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>If you go down this route it is possible that you have to make
changes to the -legalMoves and -applyMove: methods. The moves returned
by -legalMoves must contain enough information to perform an undo
operation. This can mean creating them might become more expensive. On
the other hand, having more information in the moves might help make
-applyMove: faster.</p>

<p>Consider Reversi as an example. If you use undoable states your
moves must contain a list of all the slots that were flipped, in
addition to the slot where you put your piece. It is impossible to
deduce this information from just a set of co-ordinates.</p>

<p>A word of warning: you have to do some profiling to find out what
works best for your specific case. In my implementation of Reversi
there is no appreciative difference in performance of the two.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods of SBAlphaBeta</h2>

<p>The SBAlphaBeta class provides the following methods. They are
defined in the <code>SBAlphaBeta.h</code> header file. Don't include
this directly though. Include the <code>AlphaBeta/AlphaBeta.h</code>
header instead.</p>


<h3>Object creation and initialisation</h3>
<dl>
<dt><pre>+ (id)newWithState:(id)this</pre></dt>
<dd><p>This method is a shortcut for calling alloc & initWithState:.</p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (id)initWithState:(id)this</pre></dt>
<dd><p>Initialises an SBAlphaBeta object with a starting state.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Current state of things</h3>

<dl>
<dt><pre>- (id)currentState</pre></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the current state. </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (unsigned)currentPlayer</pre></dt>
<dd><p>Returns 1 or 2, depending on whose turn it is to move. "Player
1" is (arbitrarily) defined to be the player whose turn it is to play
at the start of the game, which is not necessarily the same as the
state itself thinks of as player 1. (It may not think of the players
in those terms; it may use @"a" or @"b" instead.) </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (double)currentFitness</pre></dt>
<dd><p>Returns currentFitness from the current state. </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (NSArray *)currentLegalMoves</pre></dt>
<dd><p>Returns available moves from the current state. </p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Searching for moves</h3>

<dl>
<dt><pre>- (id)moveFromSearchWithDepth:(unsigned)depth</pre></dt>
<dd><p>Performs a fixed-depth search to the given <code>depth</code>.
Returns the best move found. </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (id)moveFromSearchWithInterval:(NSTimeInterval)interval</pre></dt>
<dd><p>Performs an iterative search for up to <code>interval</code>
seconds. Returns the best move found. </p>

<p>Fractional seconds are supported, so an interval of 0.3 makes for a
search that lasts up to 300 milliseconds. </p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Performing and undoing moves</h3>

<dl>
<dt><pre>- (id)performMove:(id)m</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Apply the given move to the current state. Returns the new
current state. </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (id)performMoveFromSearchWithDepth:(unsigned)depth</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Performs a fixed-depth search to the given <code>depth</code>
and applies the best move found. </p></dd>

<dt>
<pre>- (id)performMoveFromSearchWithInterval:(NSTimeInterval)interval</pre>
</dt>

<dd><p>Performs an iterative search for up to <code>interval</code>
seconds and applies the best move found. </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (id)undoLastMove</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Undo one position from the given state. Returns the new current
state. </p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>The current state of affairs</h3>

<dl>

<dt><pre>- (BOOL)isForcedPass</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Returns true if the current player is forced to pass. (I.e.,
her only legal move is a pass move.) </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (BOOL)isGameOver</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Returns true if the game is finished, false otherwise.
</p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (unsigned)winner</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Returns 1 or 2 for the winning player, or 0 if the game ended
in a draw. (This method is only available if your states implement the
SBAlphaBetaStatus protocol.) </p></dd>

</dl>


<h3>Enquiring about the past</h3>

<dl>

<dt><pre>- (id)lastMove</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Returns the last move that was applied. </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (unsigned)countPerformedMoves</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Returns a count of the number of moves since the initial state.
</p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (unsigned)depthForSearch</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Return the depth reached by the last iterative search. The
returned value is undefined if no iterative search has been executed
yet. </p></dd>

<dt><pre>- (unsigned)stateCountForSearch</pre></dt>

<dd><p>Return the number of states visited by the last search. </p>

<p>If the last search was an iterative one, the number of visited
states is accumulated across all the <em>completed</em> iterations. </p></dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="maturity">Code & interface maturity</h2>

<p>The underlying code is quite mature and by now pretty well tested.
However, I'm still not entirely happy with the interface. Thus the API
may still change between releases. The broad strokes are there,
though, so if something <em>does</em> change you should find it
relatively simple to update to any new versions.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<p>None known. Bug reports are very welcome and will be acted upon
swiftly.</p>
