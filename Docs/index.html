<p><em>AlphaBeta</em> is a Cocoa Objective-C framework encapsulating
the Alpha-Beta game-tree search algorithm. It can be used to create
computer players for a whole range of games including Chess, Checkers,
Go, Reversi/Othello, Connect-4 and Tic-Tac-Toe to mention but a
few.</p>

<p>More specifically, Alpha-Beta search can be used in all two-player
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum">zero sum</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information">perfect
information</a> games. The term <em>two-player</em> just means that
there must be two opposing sides. (Football is considered two-player,
for example.) A <em>zero sum</em> game is one where an advantage for
one player is an equally large disadvantage for the other. <em>Perfect
information</em> basically rules out any game that has an element of
chance. This last rule disqualifies Yatzee, Poker and&mdash;most
definitely&mdash;Jenga.</p>

<p>The framework aims to be easy to use: there's no need for prior
experience with AI (Artificial Intelligence). You don't actually have
to learn anything about game-tree search in order to use this
framework. Should you desire to, the <a
href="#resources">resources</a> section has links to more information
about game-tree search and relevant algorithms.</p>


<h2 id="usage">Using AlphaBeta</h2>

<p>To use AlphaBeta you need to instantiate an instance of SBAlphaBeta
and give it an instance of your game state class. This instance will
be used as the initial state of the game. A state is a discrete game
state--a point in time between moves. A move contains the information
required for transforming a state into its successor.</p>

<p>AlphaBeta does not care what types your states and moves are. (With
one exception: see note on <a href="#passmoves">pass moves</a> below).
Your states must implement the SBAlphaBetaSearching protocol. Moves
must implement this informal protocol: </p>

<pre>
-(BOOL)isEqual:(id)object;
-(unsigned)hash;
</pre>

<p>Personally I like using a mixture of NSArray, NSDictionary,
NSString and NSNumber instances for moves. These already implement the
informal protocol described above.</p>

<p>Though not required it is advised that you override -description to
return something sensible for both states and moves. This can make
debugging easier if you make a false step and feed SBAlphaBeta
unexpected data, as the exceptions thrown will make more sense.</p>

<p id="passmoves"><strong>Pass moves</strong> are exceptions to the
rule of not caring about type. Pass moves are represented by an NSNull
instance. If your game does not support pass moves you can ignore this
point. </p>

<h2 id="advanced">Advanced usage</h2>

<p>AlphaBeta calls -copy on your states a lot during search. If this
is expensive you may want your states to implement the
SBUndoableAlphaBetaSearching protocol in addition to
SBAlphaBetaSearching.</p>

<p>If you go down this route it is possible that you have to make
changes to the -legalMoves and -applyMove: methods. The moves returned
by -legalMoves must contain enough information to perform an undo
operation. This can mean creating them might become more expensive. On
the other hand, having more information in the moves might help make
-applyMove: faster.</p>

<p>Consider Reversi as an example. If you use undoable states your
moves must contain a list of all the slots that were flipped, in
addition to the slot where you put your piece. It is impossible to
deduce this information from just a set of co-ordinates.</p>

<p>You have to implement both and do some profiling to find out what
works best for your case. In my implementation of Reversi there is no
appreciative difference in performance of the two.</p>

<h2 id="maturity">A note on code & interface maturity</h2>

<p>Though the underlying code is quite mature and well tested, I'm
still not entirely happy with the interface. Thus the API may still
change between releases. The broad strokes are there, however, so you
should find it relatively simple to update to any new versions.</p>

<p>None known. Bug reports are very welcome and will be acted upon
swiftly.</p>
