/** 
Encapsulation of the Alpha-Beta algorithm.

SBAlphaBeta is a generic implementation of the Alpha-Beta algorithm. It doesn't need to know anything at all about the rules of your game; other than that it is between two players that takes turn moving. It can be used to create AIs for a whole host of games.

To use SBAlphaBeta you need to initialise it with an instance of your game state class; this will be used as the initial state of the game. A state is a discrete game state--a point in time between moves. A move contains the information required for transforming a state into its successor.

SBAlphaBeta cares not what the types of your states and moves are. States can be immutable or mutable and must implement either the SBAlphaBetaState or the SBMutableAlphaBetaState protocol. The section @ref statemutability_sec has a short discussion on the pros and cons of each.

Moves must implement the below informal protocol. Personally I like using  NSArray, NSDictionary, NSString and NSNumber; these classes already implement the required protocol. I've also found NSNull convenient for pass moves.

@code
-(BOOL)isEqual:(id)object;
-(unsigned)hash;
@endcode

Though not required it is advised that you override -description to return something sensible for both states and moves. This can make debugging easier if you make a false step and feed SBAlphaBeta unexpected data, as the exceptions thrown will make more sense.

@section statemutability_sec Should I use mutable or immutable states?

It's a good question. I've toyed with the idea of only supporting one, to avoid the dilemma of having to choose. The problem is that I can't pick which one to support. They each have their own pros and cons. 

If you go with mutable states, the moves you return from -movesAvailable must contain enough information to undo the effects of a move; with immutable states they don't. This can mean your moves must contain more information. On the other hand, having more information in the moves might make applying the move cheaper.

Consider Reversi: if you use mutable states your moves must contain a list of all the slots that were flipped, in addition to the slot where you put your piece, because it is impossible to deduce that when the time comes to revert the move. This uses more memory and if your game has a high branching factor this might become significant. On the other hand if you use immutable states there is no need to implement undo; SBAlphaBeta has a copy of the previous state on its history stack already, so it just pops off the current one. Your moves don't need to contain anything but the coordinates of the slot you're putting your piece. However, your routine to perform a move must now be more clever and find which pieces to flip; with rich moves you just have to flip the pieces specified in the move.

With immutable states you have to make a complete copy of the entire state, which can be expensive; on the other hand undo is extremely cheap, and you don't have to write any code to do it. Again, SBAlphaBeta just pops a stack.
