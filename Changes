v0.3 @ 2007-XX-XX)

* Fixed several major bugs:
  - Alpha-Beta cut-offs are now in effect. This speeds up searches enormously.
  - The iterative search routines would end a search early if it found
    an early end state (rather than if _all_ the 'leaf' states it saw were
    early end states).
* Speeded up search a bit by not computing available moves if we have
  reached the maximum search depth.
* Added an -endStateScore method to both the state protocols.
* Added -playerTurn method to SBAlphaBeta. For simplicity SBAlphaBeta
  enumerates the players 1 and 2, regardless of how the states
  internally thinks of them, and 1 _always starts_.
* Added -winner method to SBAlphaBeta now that it is capable of deducing
  the winner of a game.
* Renamed the project (not the classes) and added an AlphaBeta.h header.
* Greatly improved the documentation.
* Greatly improved the timekeeping of the iterative search.

v0.2 @ 2007-03-27

This release has seen substantial updates. This is _not_ a drop-in
replacement for version 0.1. Rather, this is a "back to sanity" release.

* Classes and interfaces have received a prefix to make their names more
  unique.
* The interfaces for states have been renamed to SBAlphaBetaState and
  SBMutableAlphaBetaState.
* There are now some minor restrictions on moves, which allows us to do
  more error checking in the controller.
* Several confusing "convenience" methods have been dropped.
* Many methods have been renamed for clarity.

v0.1 @ 2006-03-11

This was the initial release.
