v0.3 @ 2007-XX-XX)

* Changed to using the modified BSD license.

* Fixed several major bugs:
  - Alpha-Beta cut-offs are now in effect. This speeds up searches enormously.
  - The iterative search routines would end a search early if it found
    an early end state (rather than if _all_ the 'leaf' states it saw were
    early end states).

* Speeded up search a bit by not computing legal moves if we have
  reached the maximum search depth.

* Added -currentPlayer method. For simplicity SBAlphaBeta
  enumerates the players 1 and 2, regardless of how the states
  internally thinks of them, and 1 _always starts_.

* Added -winner method to SBAlphaBeta to allow it to answer "who won
  then?" queries. There's an additional *optional* category your states
  must implement to use this method.

* Renamed the project (not the classes) and added an AlphaBeta.h header.

* Greatly improved the timekeeping of the iterative search.

* Destill the documentation from in-code doxygen-style to be external
  and hand-written. This makes it simpler to write good, coherent
  documentation that reads well. 

* Take a copy of the current state at the beginning of each search.
  This ensures that while we're in a search we'll always be returning
  the same state. (This is useful when using multiple threads.)

  The current version shows a small decrease in performance over what
  has been benchmarked before. Searching to ply 9 went up to about
  27.5 seconds from about 26 seconds. At lower plies the difference is
  pretty much insignificant.

* Add note about Gnome Iagno heritage in the Reversi state class.
  (Dunno how that was lost.)

* Renamed protocols:
  s/SBMutableAlphaBetaState/SBUndoableAlphaBetaSearching/g
  s/SBAlphaBetaState/SBAlphaBetaSearching/g

* Cleaned up logic in a couple of places now that the protocols have a
  proper subset / superset relationship.

* Removed the separate protocol header. The state protocols now live
  in the main class header instead.

* Made the required state protocol a proper subset of the optional
  state protocol. All states must now implement the NSCopying protocol.

* Renamed almost all the methods. (Again. Sorry.)
  s/currentPlayerMustPass/isForcedPass/g
  s/applyMoveFrom(\w+)/performMoveFrom\1/g
  s/moveFromSearchWithPly/moveFromSearchWithDepth/g
  s/undoTransformWithMove/undoMove/g
  s/countStatesVisited/stateCountForSearch/g
  s/plyReachedForSearch/depthForSearch/g
  s/playerTurn/currentPlayer/g
  s/countMoves/countPerformedMoves/g
  s/applyMove/performMove/g                 (controller)
  s/movesAvailable/currentLegalMoves/g      (controller)
  s/movesAvailable/legalMoves/              (state protocols)
  s/currentFitness/fitness/g                (state protocols)


v0.2 @ 2007-03-27

This release has seen substantial updates. This is _not_ a drop-in
replacement for version 0.1. Rather, this is a "back to sanity" release.

* Classes and interfaces have received a prefix to make their names more
  unique.

* The interfaces for states have been renamed to SBAlphaBetaState and
  SBMutableAlphaBetaState.

* There are now some minor restrictions on moves, which allows us to do
  more error checking in the controller.

* Several confusing "convenience" methods have been dropped.

* Many methods have been renamed for clarity.

v0.1 @ 2006-03-11

This was the initial release.
