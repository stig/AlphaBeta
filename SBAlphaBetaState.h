Common methods for the state protocols.

This protocol exists solely because I hate duplication. Please pretend that it doesn't exist. You should look at the documentation for the protocols inheriting from this one instead.

Should return the current fitness. The fitness is a number indicating for fortuitous the state is for the current player.

Use a high positive number for very good, high negative number for very bad. The legal range is +/- INFINITY.

/**
Indicates the result at an end state. Return a positive value if the receiving state is a winning state for the current player, negative for a loss, or 0 if it is a draw. The result of calling this method on a non-leaf state is undefined.

SBAlphaBeta only cares whether the values returned from this method are negative, positive or zero; but you may wish to implement it to return a score that you can use for a high-score list.

Protocol for working with mutable states.

The opposite of -transformWithMove:. The move passed in will always be the <em>last</em> move that was applied to it with -transformWithMove:, and the effect of this method should be to produce the previous state.

This means that each move returned by -movesAvailable must contain enough information to revert the move. For Othello, for example, each move could be an of co-ordinates: the first is the slot to put the current piece, the remaining are for pieces to flip.
