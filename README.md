Version 0.2 (Mar 26, 2007)
--------------------------

[SBAlphaBeta](http://code.brautaset.org/SBAlphaBeta/) is a Foundation framework for
creating AIs for many 2-player games. It encapsulates the
[Alpha-beta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning) algorithm.  No prior
experience with Artificial Intelligence is necessary in order to use this framework.

Version 0.2 is a "back to sanity" release, incorporating improvements found by developing
more games against the framework. Changes include: classes and interfaces have received a
common prefix. The interfaces for states have been renamed. There are now some minor
restrictions on moves, which allows us to do more error checking. Several "convenience
methods" ultimately turned out to be confusing and have been dropped; many of the
remaining methods have been renamed for clarity.
